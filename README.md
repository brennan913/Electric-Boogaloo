# Electric Boogaloo
A string based language for representing musical notation using only ASCII characters. Created as a group project for Bjarne Stroustrup's "Design Using C++" course (COMS 4995) by Brennan Xavier McManus, Conder Shou, and Dean Deng. Implemented as an expansion of the C++11 MIDI-format parsing library [midifile](https://midifile.sapp.org/). A presentation summarizing the content below can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EE-DDxcoUErdAO15qPXVpA72CugJSXEge9kujGQXx34/edit?usp=sharing). 

# Representing Music 
Electric Boogaloo represents real musical concepts programmatically: program with `Notes` and `Keys`, not unsigned integers. It also provides a flexible, string-based input language for the representation of music. The following is an example of hot cross buns, written using Electric Boogaloo:
