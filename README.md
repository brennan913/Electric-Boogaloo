# Electric Boogaloo
A string based language for representing musical notation using only ASCII characters. Created as a group project for Bjarne Stroustrup's "Design Using C++" course (COMS 4995) by Brennan Xavier McManus, Conder Shou, and Dean Deng. Implemented as an expansion of the C++11 MIDI-format parsing library [midifile](https://midifile.sapp.org/).
